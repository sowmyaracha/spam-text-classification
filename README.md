# Spam Text Classification

This project implements a machine learning system to classify text messages as either spam or ham (legitimate messages). 
Using natural language processing techniques and neural networks, the system achieves high accuracy in identifying spam messages.

## Description
Develop an automated spam detection system that can accurately classify text messages, helping users filter unwanted spam communications.

## Dataset
Source: TEXT (3).csv containing labeled text messages
Format: Messages with binary labels (spam/ham)
Split: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing

## Requirements
This guide covers installation for different environments: **Local Machine**, **Google Colab**, **Anaconda**, and **Virtual Environments**.

## Installation
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher (3.8+ recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB+ recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB free space
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Quick Install (One Command)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
How to run code:
```bash
python spamham.ipynb
```

## Results
This spam classification system demonstrates effective use of NLP and deep learning for text classification. 
The pipeline from raw text to prediction is comprehensive and follows industry best practices. 
With the suggested improvements, particularly in handling class imbalance and adding richer features, the system can achieve production-ready performance.
